```

#### Option 2: Superadmin Login (Full Access)
```bash
curl -X POST "http://31.97.224.169:8003/api/superadmin/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "superadmin@example.com",

## Integration Notes

### Authentication Integration
- Coach login generates JWT tokens with "coach" role
- Tokens are valid for 24 hours by default
- Password reset functionality available through admin endpoints

### Course Integration
- Coaches can be assigned as instructors to courses
- `instructor_id` in courses references coach IDs
- Coach expertise areas should align with course categories

### Branch Integration
- Coaches can be assigned to specific branches
- Branch assignments affect coach permissions and access
- Multiple coaches can be assigned to the same branch

### User Management Integration
- Coaches are stored in a separate `coaches` collection
- Different from regular users in the `users` collection
- Unified authentication system supports both coach and user tokens

### Notification Integration
- SMS and WhatsApp notifications sent on coach creation
- Temporary passwords communicated securely
- Activity logging for all coach management operations
